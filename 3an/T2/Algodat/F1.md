perfect matching = par av allt
unstable = något par vill hellre byta enligt båda parter
stable matching = perfect matching with no unstable pairs

* When it is not obvious to determine the number of iterations, we should try to find what kind of progress is made each iteration.

Lemma:
*The GS algorithm terminates after at most $n^{2}$ iterations.*
*(O($n^{3}$) om företaget måste kolla dess lista varje gång)*
Proof: Tänk.

* Istället för en preference list, låt index i listan vara student $i-1$ (student 1 är index 0) och dess värde dess prioritet.
* Companies are matched with increasingly preferred students.
* Students are matched with decreasingly preferred companies.

Lemma:
*If a student is free, there remains a company it has not applied to.*
Proof: Trivialt.

Lemma:
*The GS algorithm produces a perfect matching.*
Proof: Trivialt.

Lemma:
*The GS algorithm produces a stable matching M.*
Proof: Boken

* For a student s a company is **valid** if (s, c) is a pair in a stable matching.
* The **best** company c is the company most preferred by s which is **valid** for it.

Theorem:
*The GS algorithm produces the stable matching { (s, c) | c = best(s) }*
Proof: Slide 31

* In other words, the matching is unique. So it does not matter in which order the students are put in a list initially.

Theorem:
*The GS algorithm produces the stable matching which is worst for companies.*
Proof: Slide 35

Five representative problems (slide 37-42):
* Interval scheduling
* Weighted interval scheduling
* Bipartite graph matching
* Independent set
* Chess
