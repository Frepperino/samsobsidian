1) alimentary canal (mouth, phatrynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine) + accessory structures (teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, pancreas, gallbladder)
   mucosa, submucosa (bindsd mucosa to muscularis), muscularis, serosa (or adventitis)
   controlled by autonomic and enteric
   motility (food movement)
   immune function through MALT in mucosa lamina propria
2) ingestions, motility, mechanical7chemical digestion, absorption, defecation
   chyme = good + digestive juices
   persistalsis
   propulsion
   segmentation (breaking and mixing with digestive juices)
3) soft palate rises to close of nasopharynx
   upper esophageal sphincter (skeletal)
   lower esophageal sphincter (smooth) at esophageal hiatus
   mucous in esophagus
   molar, cuspid, incisor
   oral vestibule
   sublingual, submandibular, => salivary amylase + chloride
   voluntary, pharyngeal, esophageal phase
4) body, cardiac, fundus, pylorus
   gastric gland:
   parietal HCl (pepsin and kill bacteria) + intrinsic factor (B12),
   chief pepsinogen (protein),
   enteroendocrine  gastrin (hcl secretion and motility), and hormones,
   mucous neck cell (who knows?)
   mucosal barrier (bicarcbonate, tight squamous cells, quick regeneration)
   oblique muscle to churn
   gastric juice (mucous, HCl, pepsin)
   cephalic (perception), gastric (gastrin and juice secretion, intestional phase
5) small intestine:
   few ml at a time
   digestion is completed in small intestine
   brush border enzymes
   migrating motility complexes (initiated by motilin)
   MALT (mucosa associated lymphoid tissue)
   duodenal gland (mucous)
   intestinal gland (intestinal juice = water and mucus)
   lacteal = lympathic capillary
   main pancreatic duct (juice drains from pancreas)
   hepatopancreatic ampulla (crossing), sphincter, 
   ileocecal sphincter
   large intestine:
   cecum, colon (ascending, transverse, desc), rectum
   mass movement
   bacterial flora (vitamins)
   many goblet cells
   anal canal, column, sinus
   epiploic appendage (fat), teniae coli (the smooth muscles), haustrum
   internal external anal sphincter
6) Bile emulsifies lipids, pancrease pancreatic juice buffers acific chyme
   ![[Pasted image 20241202110023.png|450]]
   hepatic portal vein to venule with nutrients. sinusoid to central vein.
   ![[Pasted image 20241202110115.png|450]]
   acinus makes pancreatic juice -> pancreatic duct -> main pancreatic duct
7) alpha-dextrin -> starch
   lactase, sucrase, maltase -> sugar
   protein -> (pepsin) + aminopeptidase
   fat: bile -> micelles -> diffusion -> triglyceride reassembly and mixed into chylomicrons -> lacteals
