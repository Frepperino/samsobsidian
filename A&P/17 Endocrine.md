1) body uses neural and endocrine for controlling.
   autocrine = for same cell
   paracrine = for nearby cells
   exocrine excretes compounds with immediate function
2) hormones derive from amino acids or lipids
   lipid soluble diffuse through membrane to intracellular receptor => bind to dna => printrrrr, vs hydrophilic => membrance receptor => G protein => cascade with second messenger (cAMP damp)
   downregulation => decrease in hormone receptor (drugs lol) vs upregulation
3) pituary gland:
   posterior: stores and releases oxytocin and ADH (axons connected to hypothalamus)
   anterior: produces and secretes 6 hormones (vasculature connected to hypothalamus)
   infundibulum = bridge between pituary gland and hypothalamus
4) thyroid:
   3 hormones
   regulate metabolism, oxygen, ATP
   hyper and hypothyroidism
5) parathyroid:
   low blood calcium => PTH => osteoclast activity => calcium levels rise
   hyperparathyroidism => too much osteoclast activity =>  high blood calcium levels => fractures and kidney stones
6) adrenal:
   on top of kindeys
   stress response
   short-term => adrenal medulla (core): adrenaline noradrenaline <=> epinephrine norepinephrine => extra oxygen supply
   long-term => adrenal cortex: cortisol, aldesterone => catabolism of glycogen, downregulation of immune system
7) pineal gland:
   pinealocytes produce melatonin when eyes receive low light
8) gonadal and placental horomones:
   GnRH hypothalamus and inhibin => FSH anterior pituary => regulate kid making stuff
   girls: progesterone (pregnancy) and estrogens
9) pancreas (exocrine and endocrine):
   alpha cells => glucagon (low blood glucose => catabolism of glycogen into glucose)
   beta cells => insulin (high blood glucose => increase cell uptake)
   2 others shit cells
10) organs with secondary endocrine func:
    GI tract produce gastrin, secretin
    kidneys produce EPO
