1) anuria = <50 ml
   oliguria = < 400 ml
   polyuria = >2.5L
   diabetis => oliguria
   urin color <= red blood cell breakdown byproducts
   white blood cell presence => UTI
2) peristalsis in ureters
   detrusor muscle (bladder muscle when emptying urine)
   external and internal urinary sphincter
3) ALL vessels enter at renal hilum
   cortical vs juxtamedullary (loop in medulla) nephrons
   afferent to efferent to capillary beds around tubules
   PCT is most active in reabsorption and secretion
   renal columns
   corpuscle = glomerulus + Bowman's capsule
   renal papillae is where collecting ducts empty into minor calyces
4) brush border also in PCT
   podocytes (adjust passive filtration) and fenestrations make fitration membrane in Bowman's capsule
   ADH makes aquaporin (water channels) in collecting ducts
   peritubular capillaries around PCT etc.
5) GFR (glomelular filtration rate)
   NFP (net filtration pressure) = glomerular blood hydrostatic pressure (GBHP) – (capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP) + blood colloid osmotic pressure (BCOP))
6) regulate water recovery: ADH or renin -> angiotensn I/II -> aldesterone
   most stuff hapens in PCT
   active transport and diffusion
   descending loop recovers water, ascending is impervious but recovers Na which reduces osmolarity
   90% of water is recovered before DCT
   countercurrent multiplier system to create high osmolarity gradient
