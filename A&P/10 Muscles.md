   membrane is sarcolemma
   striation is sarcomeres
   sarcoplasmic rericulum stores Ca++
   filament, myofibril, muscle fiber (cell), fascicle, muscle
3) actin, troponin, tropomyosin stuff, lactic acid, pyruvic acid
4) motor unit = motor neuron + attached muscle fibers
   summed twitches = tetanus
5) ATP for contractions
   3 mechanisms, creatine phosphate (first 15 seconds), anaerobic glycolysis (short period), aerobic metabolism (uses oxygen to produce much more atp)
   three fibers, slow oxidative, fast oxidative, fast glycolytic. SO use arobic. FO use aerobic but higher tension. FG use anaerobic for fast powerful
6) sarcopenoa = age related atrophy
   fast fibers have much glycogen and much capillary, slow have many mitchondria
7) cardiac differ from skeletal as they have intercalcated discs and desmosomes to hold fibers together.
