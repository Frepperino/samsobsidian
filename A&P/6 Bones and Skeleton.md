1) hematopoiesis = blood cell prouction
2) sesamoid bone (embeded in tendons and patella)
   ligament = bone to bone
   tendon = bone to muscle
   long bones are levers, short bones limited movement, sesamoid protect from forces
3) osteogenic cells (stem) => osteblasts  (makes new bone) => osteocytes
   osteoclasts reabsorb bone (macrophages)
   articulation (where bones meet)
   articular cartilage (end of epihysis)
   canaliculi (cytoplasmic extension channel for nutrients)
   central canal (Haversian canal)![[Pasted image 20241130153313.png|800]]
   diploe (spongy bone in flat bones)
   epiphyseal plate
   lacunae (space for osteocyte)
   medullary cavity
   nutrient foramen
   osteon
   Volkmanns canal (perforating canal)
   trabeculae (matrix structure in spongy bone)
4) endochondral ossification (inner hyaline cartilage death after calcification, blood vessel carrying osteogenic cells. repeated again for epiphyseal end (secondary ossification centers))
   intramembranosus ossification (direct development from undifferentiated connective tissue)
   modeling
   bone growth (reserve zone (paxa), proliferative zone (mitosis), maturation, calcified matrix) ![[Pasted image 20241130161550.png|500]]
5) -
6) appendicular v axial skeleton
   thoracic cage (ribs + sternum)
   clavicle, sternum, scapula, humerus, ulna and radiu (drup), carpals, metacarpals, phalanges, femur, tibia (smalbenet) and fibula, tarsals, metatarsals, phalanges
7) ![[Pasted image 20241130162941.png|500]] ![[Pasted image 20241130163012.png|600]]
   bone repair (hematoma, internal and external calli (cartilage by peri and endosteum), osetoclast and osteoblast work and replace cartilage)
   open vs closed reducation (same as fracture)
