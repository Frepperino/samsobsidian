1) Sensation, integration, generation of response
   CNS: collection of neuron cell bodies = nucleus, bundle of axons = tract
   PNS: collection of neuron cell bodies = ganglion, bundle of axons = nerve
   somatic nervous system (SNS) moves skeletal muscles and incl. related sensory and integrative functions vs autonomic nervous system (ANS) affec cardiac or smooth muscle and glands.
   senation and integration can overlap between somatic and autonomic
   enteric nervous system controls digestive organs.
   glial cell = non-neuronal cells that support neurons
   myelin speeds up transmission
   process = extension of cell body
   soma = neuronal cell body
2) CNS glial cells: astrocytes (support neurons and maintain blood-brain barrier), oligodendrocytes (myelinating), microglia (phagocytes), ependymal (cerebrospinal fluid)
   PNS glial cells: satellite cells (support), Schwann cells (insulate axons)
   axon hillock, initial segment (where action potentials are generated), axon segments (insulated) between nodes of Ranvier, axon terminal

3) sensory pathway: sensory ending travel with axon to spinal cord. Then to brain.
   motor pathway (2 cells): upper motor neurona (soma in cerebral cortex) connects to lower motor neuron (extends to the muscle) in spinal cord.
4) ion channel types: ligand-gated (neurotransmitter), mechanically gated (physical event), voltage-gated (voltage, triggers depolarization)
   -70 mv Na outside, K inside. stimulus depolarizes, voltage-gated further if past -55 mV. then repolarization, refractory, hyperpolarization, refractory period. only one action potential at a time. relative refractory period: next action must be stronger to overcome the k leaving the cell.
   saltatory conduction if myelinated
5) electrical or chemical (more common) synapses
   postsynaptic potential) PSP is received graded potential. is excitatory (EPSP, depolarizing) or inhibitory (IPSP, hyperpolarizing) then we sum it
   generator potential (denrdrites directly) vs receptor potential (from sensory receptor cell) 
   transmittion if change in voltage is 15 mv cuz -70 + 15 = -55 mv juu
