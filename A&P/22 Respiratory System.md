1) conduction zone: nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles. ciliated (move toward throat) columnar epithelium with goblet cells
   respiratory zone: terminal bronchioles, alveoli
   conchae(expand area to warm, humidify, clean)
   nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx, epiglottis
   blood air barrier (alveolar epithelium, capillary endothelium)
   terminal bronchiole, respiratory bronchiole = attachment for alveoli
   alveolar pore (pore between alveoli)
   alveolar sac (cluster of alveol)
   type 1 alveolar cell (squamous epitheluim permeable to gas), type 2 (produce pulmonary surfactant to reduce surface tension)
   alveolar macrophages
2) hilum (blood, lymphatic, nerves enter)
   pleura protects lungs when breathing and adhesive
   right is shorter than left (3 lobes). left has cardiac notch
3) alveolar dead space (air space in alveoli that doesnt take part)
   anatomical dead space (same but airway)
   dorsal respiratory group (DRG) in medulla oblongata controls diaphragm for inspiration, controlled by pneumotaxic center
   quiet breathing (autonomic beathing at rest)
   Total lung capacity (TLC) = RV + IRV + ERV + TV
   VC (vital capacity) = TV + ERV +IRV = volume that participate in gas exchange
   Tidal volume (TV) = air that enters during quiet breathing
   RV (Residal volume) = air after max exhalation
   ERV (expiratory reserve volume) = air that can be exhaled beyond normal exhalation
   IRV (inspiratory reserve volume) = deep inhalation past TV
4) Dalton's law = partial pressures
   Henry's law = gas dissolving in liquid depends on partial pressure
   oxygen DIFFUSES accros respiratory membrane into blood
   external (alveoli) and internal (tissue) respiration
   if insufficient ventilation cappilary constricts to redirect to alveoli with better ventilation
5) oxygen bind to one of four heme. becomes easier with more
   fetal hemoglobin has greater affinity  for oxygen
   co2 has three transporation modes: dissolved, bicarbonate or carbaminohemoglobin. most is bicarbonate = co2 + water with carbonic anyhdrase, made in erythrocytes chloride shift out of plasma and reverse into co2 then diffuse out
   Bohr effect, relationship between ph and oxygen disassociation from hemoglobin
6) hyperventilation akes abnormally low blood co2 and high ph blood
   acute mounatin sickness caused by low oxygen partial pressure in air
