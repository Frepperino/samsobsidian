1) fibrous joint (fibrous conn tissue), cartilaginous joint (cartilage), synovial joint (synovial fluid joint cavity)
   synarthrosis (essential immobile, strong, skull), amphiarthrosis (limited movement, intervertebral discs), diarthrosis (freely movable)
   uniaxial diarthrosis (elbow), biaxial (2 planes), multiaxial (3 planes) 
2) fibrous joint:
   fontanelles (kids fibrous connective tissue in skull)
   suture (fibrous joint between bones in skull), syndesmosis (fibrous joint between parallel bones connected by interosseous membrane or ligament (if narrow), radius and ulna, tibia and fibula)
3) cartilagnious joint:
   symphysis (fibro cartilage, vertebraes), synchondrosis (hyaline cartilage, kids)
4) synovial joint:
   articular cartilage on surface of bones, articular capsule in joint.
   synovial fluid by synovial membrane
   strengtheneed by ligaments, extrisinc (outside capsule) or intrinsic (fused with articular capsule) or intracapsular (inside articular capsule)
   some have meniscus (disc between bones)
   muscles and tendons support joint
   bursae contain fluid that reduce friction between stuff. subcutaneous (skind and bone), submusclar (muscle and bone/muscle), subtendinous (bone/tendon)
   tendon sheaths (same as bursae surround tendons as they cross joint)
   six types of synovial, pivot and hinge (elbow knee) joints are uniaxial, condyuloid (metacarpophalangeal) and saddle (thumb) are biaxial, plane (vertabrae) and ball-and-socket joint (should and hip) are multiaxial
5) abduction (laterally away) vs adduction (medially toward)
   flexion (decreases angle of joint) vs extension (increases angle of joint)
